"Wound healing is an importantABHD10 physiological process to maintain the integrity of 
skin after trauma, either by accident or by intent procedure. The normal wound 
healing involves three successive but overlapping phases, including 
hemostasis/inflammatory phase, proliferative phase, and remodeling phase. 
Aberration of wound healing, such as excessive wound healing (hypertrophic scar 
and keloid) or chronic wound (ulcer) impairs the normal physical function. A 
large number of sophisticated experimental studies have provided insights into 
wound healing. This article highlights the information after 2010, and the main 
text includes (i) wound healing; (ii) wound healing in fetus and adult; (iii) 
prostaglandins and wound healing; (iv) the pathogenesis of excessive wound 
healing; (v) the epidemiology of excessive wound healing; (vi) in vitro and 
in vivo studies for excessive wound healing; (vii) stem cell therapy for 
excessive wound healing; and (viii) the prevention strategy for excessive wound 
healing."
"Cutaneous wound healing is a complex process involving blood clotting, 
inflammation, new tissue formation, and finally tissue remodeling. It is well 
described at the histological level, but the genes that regulate skin repair 
have only partially been identified. Many experimental and clinical studies have 
demonstrated varied, but in most cases beneficial, effects of exogenous growth 
factors on the healing process. However, the roles played by endogenous growth 
factors have remained largely unclear. Initial approaches at addressing this 
question focused on the expression analysis of various growth factors, 
cytokines, and their receptors in different wound models, with first functional 
data being obtained by applying neutralizing antibodies to wounds. During the 
past few years, the availability of genetically modified mice has allowed 
elucidation of the function of various genes in the healing process, and these 
studies have shed light onto the role of growth factors, cytokines, and their 
downstream effectors in wound repair. This review summarizes the results of 
expression studies that have been performed in rodents, pigs, and humans to 
localize growth factors and their receptors in skin wounds. Most importantly, we 
also report on genetic studies addressing the functions of endogenous growth 
factors in the wound repair process."
"Wound healing is an evolutionarily conserved, complex, multicellular process 
that, in skin, aims at barrier restoration. This process involves the 
coordinated efforts of several cell types including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, 
endothelial cells, macrophages, and platelets. The migration, infiltration, 
proliferation, and differentiation of these cells will culminate in an 
inflammatory response, the formation of new tissue and ultimately wound closure. 
This complex process is executed and regulated by an equally complex signaling 
network involving numerous growth factors, cytokines and chemokines. Of 
particular importance is the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, transforming 
growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), granulocyte macrophage colony 
stimulating factor (GM-CSF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), connective 
tissue growth factor (CTGF), interleukin (IL) family, and tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha family. Currently, patients are treated by three growth factors: 
PDGF-BB, bFGF, and GM-CSF. Only PDGF-BB has successfully completed randomized 
clinical trials in the Unites States. With gene therapy now in clinical trial 
and the discovery of biodegradable polymers, fibrin mesh, and human collagen 
serving as potential delivery systems other growth factors may soon be available 
to patients. This review will focus on the specific roles of these growth 
factors and cytokines during the wound healing process."
"Chronic wounds, such as ABHD10 pressure ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and venous leg 
ulcers, are associated with high costs, poor quality of life, and significant 
morbidity and mortality. A chronic wound develops when progression through the 
normal phases of wound healing goes awry, creating a hostile environment with 
elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs), destruction of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, 
and diminished activity of growth factors and other soluble mediators. The 
advent of advanced wound care therapies allows for a targeted approach to the 
treatment of nonhealing wounds by addressing specific molecular defects in 
healing. Collagen is an essential building block of the skin that when utilized 
as an adjunctive wound therapy stimulates and recruits immune cells and 
fibroblasts and martyrs itself for degradation by MMPs, thereby preserving 
native ECM structure and promoting healing. Particulate or powdered collagen is 
processed to minimize covalent cross-linking and is purported to exert its 
biologic activity immediately upon application. This article critically reviews 
the current evidence for collagen powder as an adjunctive therapy for chronic 
wounds and presents indications, limitations, and principles of use. In general, 
there is a need for high quality studies and randomized control trials to 
support its use in clinical practice"
"Antimicrobial peptides ABHD10 (AMPs) are the natural antibiotics recognized for their 
potent antibacterial and wound healing properties. Bare AMPs have limited 
activity following topical application attributable to their susceptibility to 
environment (hydrolysis, oxidation, photolysis), and wound (alkaline pH, 
proteolysis) related factors as well as minimal residence time. Therefore, the 
formulation of AMPs is essential to enhance stability, prolong delivery, and 
optimize effectiveness at the wound site. Different topical formulations of AMPs 
have been developed so far including nanoparticles, hydrogels, creams, 
ointments, and wafers to aid in controlling bacterial infection and enhance 
wound healing process in vivo. Herein, an overview is provided of the AMPs and 
current understanding of their formulations for topical wound healing 
applications along with suitable examples. Furthermore, future prospects for the 
development of effective combination AMP formulations are discussed. STATEMENT 
OF SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic wound infection and subsequent development of 
antibiotic resistance are serious clinical problems affecting millions of people 
worldwide. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) possess great potential in effectively 
killing the bacteria with minimal risk of resistance development. However, AMPs 
susceptibility to degradation following topical application limits their 
antimicrobial and wound healing effects. Therefore, development of an optimized 
topical formulation with high peptide stability and sustained AMP delivery is 
necessary to maximize the antimicrobial and wound healing effects. The present 
review provides an overview of the state-of-art in the field of topical AMP 
formulations for wound healing. Current developments in the field of topical AMP 
formulations are reviewed and future prospects for the development of effective 
combination AMP formulations are discussed"
"Regeneration and tissue repair processes ABHD10consist of a sequence of molecular and 
cellular events which occur after the onset of a tissue lesion in order to 
restore the damaged tissue. The exsudative, proliferative, and extracellular 
matrix remodeling phases are sequential events that occur through the 
integration of dynamic processes involving soluble mediators, blood cells, and 
parenchymal cells. Exsudative phenomena that take place after injury contribute 
to the development of tissue edema. The proliferative stage seeks to reduce the 
area of tissue injury by contracting myofibroblasts and fibroplasia. At this 
stage, angiogenesis and reepithelialization processes can still be observed. 
Endothelial cells are able to differentiate into mesenchymal components, and 
this difference appears to be finely orchestrated by a set of signaling proteins 
that have been studied in the literature. This pathway is known as Hedgehog. The 
purpose of this review is to describe the various cellular and molecular aspects 
involved in the skin healing process."
"Wound healing is a complex processABHD10 which depends on the presence of various 
types of cells, growth factors, cytokines and the elements of extracellular 
matrix. A wound is a portal of entry for numerous pathogens, therefore during 
the evolution wound healing process has formed very early, being critical for 
the survival of every individual. Stem cells, which give rise to their early 
descendants progenitor cells and subsequently differentiated cells, play a 
specific role in the process of wound healing. Among the most important cells 
which take part in wound healing the following cells need to be distinguished: 
epidermal stem cells, dermal precursor of fibroblasts, adipose-derived stem 
cells as well as bone marrow cells. The activity of these cells is strictly 
regulated by various growth factors, inter alia epidermal growth factor (EGF), 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), 
transforming growth factor (TGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Any 
disorders in functioning of stem cells and biological activity of growth factors 
may lead to the defects in wound healing, for instance delayed wound healing or 
creation of hypertrophic scars. Therefore, knowledge concerning the mechanisms 
of wound healing is extremely essential from clinical point of view. In this 
review the current state of the knowledge of the role of stem cells and growth 
factors in the process of wound healing has been presented. Moreover, some 
clinical aspects of wound healing as well as the possibility of the therapy 
based on stem cells and growth factors have included"
"Wound management in diabetic ABHD10 patient is of an extreme clinical and social 
concern. The delayed and impaired healing makes it more critical for research 
focus. The research on impaired healing process is proceeding hastily evident by 
new therapeutic approaches other than conventional such as single growth factor, 
dual growth factor, skin substitutes, cytokine stimulators, cytokine inhibitors, 
matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, gene and stem cell therapy, extracellular 
matrix and angiogenesis stimulators. Although numerous studies are available 
that support delayed wound healing in diabetes but detailed mechanistic insight 
including factors involved and their role still needs to be revealed. This 
review mainly focuses on the molecular cascades of cytokines (with growth 
factors) and erstwhile factors responsible for delayed wound healing, molecular 
targets and recent advancements in complete healing and its cure. Present 
article briefed recent pioneering information on possible molecular targets and 
treatment strategies including clinical trials to clinicians and researchers 
working in similar area"
