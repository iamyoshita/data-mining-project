Had to compress the txt file from pubmed as it was >25mb.

Converted the 10000 abstracts from txt to csv file "woundabstracts.csv". So the first cell in jupyter can be commented. (don't comment the libraries)


Tried using gensim andchecked similary of "wound" with different proteins,genes.

try1 is the jupyter file, can check its output on github by clicking on this file. The red marked text in the output are not errors but just time log. 

must execute "conda install -c conda-forge spacy-model-en_core_web_sm" to install spacy package.

I tried with just 10 abstracts for now. And the parameters must be tuned.
